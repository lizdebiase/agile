#Our Digital Service Plays

**Play 1: Understand What People Need**

<table>
<tr><td><b>Checklist</b></td> <td><b>What we did</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Early in the project, spend time with current and prospective users of the service</td> <td>As part of our Sprint zero and backlog grooming sessions, We worked with the product owner/prospective user to understand the requirements of the challenge and the vision of the MVP </td></tr>
<tr><td>Use a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods to determine people’s goals, needs, and behaviors; be thoughtful about the time spent</td> <td>Our Interaction designer researcher met with the product owner /user and elicited information about their preferences, habits, expectations for easy-to-use systems, and their preconceptions about the processes related to employee recognition. We used this information to identify target audiences and their goals/needs/behaviors. We used persona sketching to identify the different user types in the product and documented their needs https://github.com/spinsys/agile/blob/master/Personas.md </td></tr>
<tr><td>Test prototypes of solutions with real people, in the field if possible</td> <td>- During the sprint and at the end of the sprints , Our interaction designer facilitated a walkthrough of an early wireframe prototype to get feedback.

At the time of the submission, the site is partially compliant. Full compliance have not been achieved due to the short duration of the prototype.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Provide users with a way to exit and return later to complete the process</td> <td>Our application does not have multi-step processes, but the application shows the current data each time the user logs back in. </td></tr>
