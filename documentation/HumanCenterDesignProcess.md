#Human Centered Design Process

Every user story has a soul!
For the MVP Prototype, we employed the Human-Centered Design process to elicit User Interface requirements 
that ultimately formed the Product Backlog.
Human-Centered Design (also referred to as “Design Thinking”) involves three phases: **Inspiration,Ideation and Implementation**.
These phases include building a sense of empathy for the users of the system that helps the team envision and design 
innovative solutions to the problem at hand. Each phase usually involves a series of iterations that help to refine and develop desirable, 
feasible, and viable solutions. 

Due to the short timeframe scope for the prototype effort, only a few review sessions were conducted. 
The product backlog was refined/developed as user stories based on feedback captured during the Human-Centered Design process. 
On larger efforts, stories would likely be grouped into Epics and Themes.

#Inspiration Phase
During the Inspiration phase, the team worked through a series of small sessions with the product owner/user to
foster understanding of the user types and their needs, hopes and desires for the system.

This session involved brainstorming solutions and ideas, and writing them on yellow post-itswithout any concern for viability or feasibility. 
We determined not “going big” with our ideas due to the time constraint of the challenge exercise and we limited ourselves
the ideas considering viability and feasibility. 

#Ideation Phase
During the Ideation phase, the team employed brainstorming,  and whiteboard sketch sessions to develop design ideas 
that met the design challenge. The initial set of user story content focused on the user needs statement.
The stories were elaborated to include more detail and acceptance criteria as they were discussed 
during the subsequent whiteboard, wireframe review, and mockup review sessions with the product owner/user.

## Whiteboard Sessions
The design concepts were sketched on a whiteboard with the internal team. The whiteboards were photographed 
for artifact archival. The designs were modified directly on the whiteboard using the feedback.

#Implementation Phase
During the Implement Phase, we tried to bring our ideas into life. We created low fidelity wireframes, personas, high fidelity
mockups and the html pages

##Low Fidelity Wireframes

Low fidelity wireframes were developed in Adobe Illustrator from the whiteboard sketches. 
We gathered the feedback from the Product user and the wireframes were modified as feedback was received.
